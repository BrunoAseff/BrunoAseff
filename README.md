I write software because I want to build tools that actually help people, not just maximize someone’s ad revenue.

I'm focused on cloud infrastructure, automation, security, and making things that work. My stack usually includes TypeScript, Linux, Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, and a lot of shell scripts I probably should’ve documented.

Some projects:

- 🧠 [nova](https://novaspaces.io/spaces) – A digital platform to reduce stress and improve focus. Productivity without the hustle cult.
- 📌 [portfolio](https://brunoaseff.com.br/) – My resume, but with better fonts.
- 👁 [eye-patch](https://github.com/BrunoAseff/eye-patch) – Uptime and security monitor for all my public-facing projects.
- 🎬 [theatre-updates](https://github.com/BrunoAseff/theatre-updates) – Tracks local cinema schedules and emails when something changes.
- 🫧 [bolhas na mão](https://bolhas.org) – A lab of simulations and visual experiments trying to make learning a little more magical.

  - [Game of Life](https://gameoflife.bolhas.org) – Conway’s classic reimagined in the browser.
  - [Ecosystem Simulator](https://ecosystem.bolhas.org) – Rabbits, foxes, and grass, all trying to survive.
