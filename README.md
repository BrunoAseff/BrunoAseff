I write software because I want to build tools that actually help people, not just maximize someone’s ad revenue.

I'm focused on cloud infrastructure, automation, security, and making things that work. My stack usually includes TypeScript, Linux, Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, and a lot of shell scripts I probably should’ve documented.

Some projects:

- 🧠 [nova](https://novaspaces.io/spaces) – A digital platform to reduce stress and improve focus. Productivity without the hustle cult.
- 📌 [portfolio](https://brunoaseff.com.br/) – My resume, but with better fonts.
- 👁 [eye-patch](https://github.com/BrunoAseff/eye-patch) – Uptime and security monitor for all my public-facing projects.
- 🎬 [theatre-updates](https://github.com/BrunoAseff/theatre-updates) – Tracks local cinema schedules and emails when something changes.
- ✈️ [flaira](https://flaira.net/) (WIP) – A travel tracking platform to log and explore your trips.
